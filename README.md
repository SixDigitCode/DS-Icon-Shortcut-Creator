# DS-Icon-Shortcut-Creator

I enjoy playing emulated DS games on my phone, and I have a folder full of shortcuts to each game of my DS library. However, those shortcuts were scaled poorly (bicubic, boooo!) and didn't look super great on their own so I made this tool to spice them up! (I took the DSi game cartridge icon and added some shadows to spruce things up). Also, the entire .html file is self-contained (images and all), so you should be able to download it to your device and run it from there (if that's your thing).

How to generate an icon:

1. Open the [generator](https://sixdigitcode.github.io/DS-Icon-Shortcut-Creator/).

2. If you already have a game icon you'd like to stylize:

   1. Click on "Upload a game icon"
   
   2. Choose a file from your computer
   
3. If you'd like to search for a game icon from DS-Scene

   1. Click on "Search DS-Scene for an icon"
   
   2. Enter a search term (i.e. "mario kart") and press enter. (The search may take a moment)
   
   3. Choose a game from the list

4. Click on "Download" to download the stylized icon

5. Click on "Make another!" to repeat the process again.

How to apply an icon to your phone: (I assume you're using DraStic and Nova Launcher, but this will likely work with other emulators and launchers as well. Your mielage may vary.)

1. If you don't have a shortcut for your game on your home screen, add it. (Open DraStic > Load New Game > [the game you want to add] > Create Shortcut)

2. Find the icon on your home screen, long-press it and choose "Edit"

3. In the "Edit shortcut" dialog box, click on the game icon

4. Choose "Gallery apps" and click on a file manager

5. Browse to where you downloaded the icon from the generator, and choose the file. (Usually something like ds_icon (3).png)

6. In the crop window, click on the crop icon (in the bottom right corner) and choose the square with the four dots (farthest to the left).

7. Drag each crop handle out as far as it will go to cover the entire image. Click Done.

8. Click Done again to exit out of the "Edit shortcut" window

9. Move this shortcut to wherever you like.

I hope you enjoy! Message me on Reddit (/u/SixDigitCode) if you have any questions.
